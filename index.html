      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>
        I was born in Colombia and have lived in Massachusetts since I was a child.  
Over the past few years I’ve taken on full responsibility for my education and living situation, balancing school with a part-time job while staying focused on my long-term goals.

My academic performance has strengthened significantly in my junior and senior years, especially as I’ve taken more advanced work in computer science and app development. Recently, I’ve been building my skills in programming, web development, and AI through personal projects and independent study.

I’m excited to continue growing as a learner and a developer. My goal is to study Computer Science with a focus on artificial intelligence, and to build tools that make everyday life easier for people facing real challenges.
      </p>
      <p>
        I’m especially interested in artificial intelligence and building tools that make life easier
        for people in real situations like mine.
